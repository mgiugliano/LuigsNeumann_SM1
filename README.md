# LuigsNeumann_SM1
Python primitives for interfacing the Luigs &amp; Neumann micro manipulators (oldest) SM1 control unit

Encouraged by the very good customer support by the Luigs and Neumann company, we are exploring how to use a (very) old SM1 micromanipulator control unit with a PC. Our motivation is enabling 'step-movements' recommended to us for increasing the success of in vivo (blind) patch-clamp experiments.


## Installation
